/* QUESTION 3
Create a function named sfTAX that accepts a number as the total order amount and a province abbreviation to calculate the correct tax amount for the order. The tax is determined by the shipping province at the
following rates:
ON has a tax rate of 13%
PQ has a tax rate of 12%
AB has a tax rate of 8%
If the province isnâ€™t provided a tax amount of zero should be applied to the order. 
Create the code to run the function and display the return value.

/* QUESTION 13
For each of th1e following scenarios, state whether a relational or No-SQL database
is more appropriate AND the reason for your choice.  
1 Mark for the choice, 2 Marks for the reason. (6 MARKS)
    

    /* Scenario 1 
    You are building a web-based inventory management system for a medium size 
    warehouse who stores products for multiple clients and provides shipping 
    services internationally.
    */
    /* 
    ANSWER:
    - Choice: Relational Database
    - Reason: 
    A relational database would be more appropriate for an inventory management system for a medium-sized warehouse with multiple clients because 
    the relational databases are good in handling structured data, relationships, and transactions and the data in this scenario, such as product 
    information, client details, and shipping records, can be well-organized into tables with defined relationship. Moreover, this can ensure about
    the data integrity and consistency.
     */
    
    /*
    Scenario 2
    You are developing a search engine to compete with Google and Bing for online retailers so their
    customers can easily find their products.
    */
    /* 
    ANSWER: 
    - Choice: NoSQL Database
    - Reason: 
    A NoSQL database would be more appropriate for developing a search engine for online retailers. This is because the NoSQL databases, 
    provide flexibility in handling unstructured or semi-structured data, which is common in search engine applications. Moreover, the NoSQL 
    databases can scale horizontally to handle large number of volumes of data and traffic, making them more suitable for the dynamic and 
    rapidly changing nature of search engine queries and results.
